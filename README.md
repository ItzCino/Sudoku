# Sudoku ðŸŽ²
Sudoku game with built-in solver!

From this project I learned how to develop GUI applications using the built in graphical module, Javax. 

This includes learning how to set up "panels", buttons, icons and textfields.

I also:
- Developed an understand for "Action" and "Event" listeners which waits for a certain action to happen before another piece of code is allowed to be run.
- That solving a Sudoku puzzle by brute forcing takes a very long time.
- Gained an understanding on time complexity and applied this to improve the efficiency of the solver.
- Developed further understanding of pointers.

> It was an interesting and fun experience figuring out how "panels" work (they essentially allow the grouping of several elements, and this grouping can then be placed on a "main" panel) and how I can retrieve and place text into the text fields. 
  Developing the solver involved a lot of learning about data structures, which helped broaden my understanding of which data structure is suitable for what application. 
  There are definitely better implementations for solving Sudoku puzzles, and my version can definitely be improved! 

## Functionalities
- Built-in puzzle solver
- Resetting function allow for puzzles to be resetted to their original state
- Loading function allows for new puzzles to be generated (to be implemented, atm there is only 1 puzzle)
- Live puzzle validation (highlights squares if there are duplicates based on sudoku rules)
- Textfields allows user to enter their solution.

## Software Requirements
> Developed and tested on Java 17.0.6 2023-01-17 LTS
- Java Development Kit
- Java Runtime Environment
- Javax (Built-in GUI module)
